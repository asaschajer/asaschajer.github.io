			<div class="project-details-content">
			  <div class="body-text">I selected a map called “Kaart van de rivier de Merwede bij Hardinxveld wegens de verzanding van de rivier ter hoogte van de Oude Wiel” (or “Map of the Merwede River 
near Hardinxveld due to the silting up of the river at the Oude Wiel”), which dates back 
to 1761. An interesting information from this map is an inscription left by the 
cartographer which states that “The depths printed in white on this year are almost 
identical with the order of Ebben, and those of the Vloeden eighteen inches above it”, 
although this was translated from Dutch using Google Translate, so I am not sure what 
to make of it yet. The cartographer of this map was Melchior Bolstra (1704-1779). </div>
