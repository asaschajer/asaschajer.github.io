			<div class="body-text"> The aim of making this map was to shows where the high carbon density areas in Oleron island are so that governments can best protect them. With this, we were able to identify where it would be best to plan more forests for carbon sequestration areas in the future. </div>
			<div class="body-text"> The region of interest I selected is the Oléron Island which is characterized by a temperate oceanic climate, with mild, sunny summers and mild winters. Oléron Island, located off the coast of France in the Bay of Biscay, is the second largest French island. It is characterized by a flat terrain, with a culmination point of 34 meters. The island features sandy beaches, marshes, and pine forests.</div>

			<div class="subheader-text">Concepts relevant in mapping and calculating areas for carbon offset planning </div>
			<div class="project-details-content">
			  <div class="body-text">Gross primary production (GPP) refers to the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide is captured and converted into organic matter through photosynthesis by over a specific period. This is vital in mapping and calculating areas for carbon offset planning because it determines the amount of carbon available for the processes linked to sequestration.  If we know that areas with high GPP are more efficient at removing CO2, which makes them good locations for carbon offset projects.</div> 		  
			  <div class="body-text">Aboveground carbon density (ACD) refers to the amount of carbon stored in aboveground biomass of vegetation, which reflects how much carbon is stored in a current forest or vegetated area. This helps us determine the effect of our carbon offset planning.</div>
			  <div class="body-text">Forest Cover (FC) is the proportion of land area that is covered by forest, which is a key element in indicating the changes in carbon storage capacity of an area.</div>
			  <div class="body-text">Carbon sequestration potential index (CSPI) identifies where the potential for carbon sequestration following afforestation would be highest in an area. It helps us understand which areas should be prioritized for conservation and reforestation based on their potential to store additional carbon.</div>

			  <div class="body-text">For this project, I uploaded the shapefile of my region of interest to Google Earth Engine (GEE), downloaded the ESA Above Ground Biomass Geotiff file and imported it into GEE. I then ran the program to get the calculation of the GPP, ACD, FC and finally CSPI layers. </div>
