			<div class="body-text">For this assignment, I decided to analyze the density and dispersion of political messages through stickers, graffiti, and posters in Utrecht using ArcGIS. I used data collected with the ArcGIS Field Maps by students from our GIS laboratory module. In order to learn how to use this specific software, we completed an ESRI certificate.</div>

			  <div class="body-text">By uploading this data into the ArcGIS map viewer, I used a heat map to represent visually the areas in Utrecht with the highest number of political messages and the one with the lowest. (i.e. stickers, posters and graffiti). As a base map, I chose an OpenStreetMap view, for us to understand on which buildings the messages were left (e.g. university buildings, political cultural centers, houses…).</div>
			  <div class="body-text">Next, I decided to find point clusters to identify clusters of point features from surrounding noise based on their spatial distribution, and to visualize the largest cluster of political messages and to which buildings they were associated with. This highlighted the analysis I ran previously with the heatmap, showing that the biggest cluster found was next to ACU (Political Cultural Center) in Voorstraat. Others were situated in the same street, near Drift (University Library) or near Janskerkhof (University buildings, Church…).</div>
